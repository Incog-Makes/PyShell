# PyShell
Simple reverse shell with a few cool commands

PREMADE COMMANDS:

help
(shows help menu)


download
(downloads and executes files via wget module, drops to temp)


shell
(shell command, basic)


specs
(prints bot core count, cpu frequency and device name)


credits
(credit menu)



Again. it's very basic, It's also single client as I forgot to make it multi threaded and didn't want to change stuff, but it works well for what it is.
